Our approach makes just one small change: 
Instead of using plain black text, we display 
text using a color gradient that wraps from the 
end of one line to the beginning of the next. 
\This gradient pulls your eyes through the text, making
reading easier and faster. The user gets to pick what
colors are used, based on what feels best (red and blue
are the most popular, but many people also like 
inverted “night modes” as well).
Skilled readers report that reading with
 these color gradients make reading easier,
  improve focus, and increase reading speed by
   up to 30 percent. For many people with dyslexia,
    the addition of these color gradients transforms the task of reading from a burden into a joy.
